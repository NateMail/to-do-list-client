# To-Do-List
### By Nathan Mailhiot

## Technology Used:
I used React to rebuild the front end in a more modern framework. I also used ES6.

## Challenges:
My major challenge with converting this project from it's previous iteration was figuring out how to layout everything in the components. Also the styling was a little bit of a challenge as well.

## Future Iterations:
I would like to add different themes to the list and maybe some different categories for to-do's.
